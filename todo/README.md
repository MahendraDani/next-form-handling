# Features (thoughts -> exceution)

## 1. Vote

- A vote between which method is preferred by devs.
- can be taken as input in feedback form and stored in database
- render a fancy graphy in landing page to get more traction.

## 2. MDX Themed Editor

- For showing code block in webiste in a cooler way with syntax highlight like [Resend](https://resend.com/) does on their landing page. Seems impressive tbh;
- [Resource](https://delba.dev/blog/next-blog-build-time-syntax-highlighting) on how it can be done
